# Unsupervised Energy Disaggregation
# From Sparse Signal Approximation to Community Detection

This algorithm for now uses the UK-DALE NILM dataset from house 3.
Beware creating the dictionary takes hours and will be ~7GB

This algorithm consists of 3 steps:
  1) Sparse signal approximation
  2) GMM clustering
  3) Community detection
