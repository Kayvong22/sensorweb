# Unsupervised Energy Disaggregation:
# From Sparse Signal Approximation to Community Detection

This algorithm for now uses the UK-DALE NILM dataset from house 3.
Beware creating the dictionary takes hours and will be ~7GB

This algorithm consists of 3 steps:
  1) Sparse signal approximation
  2) GMM clustering
  3) Community detection

Everything in the folder HP-detection is source code from the author. The file Demo.py is my most updated version of my code. I will update it again shortly.
